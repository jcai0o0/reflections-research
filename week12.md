In this week, I would like to explore something that personally interests me. Here are two interesting papers that aim to help deep learning practitioners better understand their models:

1. Opening the black box - data driven visualization of neural networks (https://doi.org/10.1109/VISUAL.2005.1532820)
2. Understanding Neural Networks Through Deep Visualization (https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.1506.06579)

Neural networks are powerful learning tools adopted by many industries and applications. However, they are often treated as black boxes, making it difficult to understand how they learn from input data and ensure consistent performance. In these two papers, the authors explore the use of data visualization techniques to help users visualize and interpret neural networks. By leveraging data visualization tools, practitioners can design more efficient neural networks and gain deeper insights into the training process.
