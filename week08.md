Neural Style Transfer (NST) has become a trending topic both in academic literature and industrial applications. It is receiving increasing attention and a variety of approaches are proposed to either improve or extend the original NST algorithm.

In this paper Neural Style Transfer: A Review (https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8732370, IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON VISUALIZATION AND COMPUTER GRAPHICS, VOL. 26, NO. 11, NOVEMBER 2020). Yongcheng Jing et. al., provide a comprehensive overview of the current progress towards NST. They were inspired by the power of CNNs,  Gatys et al. first studied how to use a CNN to reproduce famous painting styles on natural images. Thir conctributions includes: 1. they investigated, classified and summarized recent advances in the field of NST, 2. they present several evaluation methods and experimentally compare different NST algorithm, 3. they summarized current challenges in this field and propose possible directions on how to deal with them in future works.
