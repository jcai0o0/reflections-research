I think the second one is not that data visualization related, so here I decide to give a reflection on another research paper: What Do We Talk About When We Talk About Dashboards? (https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8443395) by Alper Sarikaya et. al.,

Dashboards are one of the most common use cases for data visualization, and their design and contexts of use are considerably different from exploratory visualization tools. In this paper, the authors look at the broad scope of how dashboards are used in practice through an analysis of dashboard examples and documentation about their use. They ystematically review the literature surrounding dashboard use, construct a design space for dashboards, and identify major dashboard types. They characterized dashboards by their design goals, levels of interaction, and the practices. Their literature review could serve as a good support for dashboard design, implementation, and use.

Old relfection:

Neural Style Transfer (NST) has become a trending topic both in academic literature and industrial applications. It is receiving increasing attention and a variety of approaches are proposed to either improve or extend the original NST algorithm.

In this paper Neural Style Transfer: A Review (https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8732370, IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON VISUALIZATION AND COMPUTER GRAPHICS, VOL. 26, NO. 11, NOVEMBER 2020). Yongcheng Jing et. al., provide a comprehensive overview of the current progress towards NST. They were inspired by the power of CNNs,  Gatys et al. first studied how to use a CNN to reproduce famous painting styles on natural images. Thir conctributions includes: 1. they investigated, classified and summarized recent advances in the field of NST, 2. they present several evaluation methods and experimentally compare different NST algorithm, 3. they summarized current challenges in this field and propose possible directions on how to deal with them in future works.
