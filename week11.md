In this week's research paper reflection, I discovered a paper titled "Mini-VLAT: A Short and Effective Measure of Visualization Literacy" for our final project.
With the increased use of visualization tools to convey complex data, measuring visualization literacy is becoming increasing vital. Many researches in the Information Visualization community have attemped to examine users' visualization literacy. Across several studies, scholars have propsed methods to assess visualization literacy, attempted to understand the current state of data visualization comprehension among the general public, and suggested various ways of learning unfamiliar visualizations to improve users' visualization literacy.

In this paper, they discuessed definition of visualization literacy, how do people measure visualization literacy, and the current public, well-know data visualization literacy test - Visualization Literacy Assessment Test (VLAT), and their solution for measuring visualization literacy.

The authors propsed a visualization literacy test - MiniVLAT. Comparing to the most well-know publicly available visualization literacy test, Visualization Literacy Assessment Test (VLAT). It's short and effective and can be used for large-scale data collection and visualization evaluation. It consists of 12 multiple-choice questions spread across 12 different visualization types, making it 5 minutes long. (The VLAT consists of 53 questions across 12 different vis types. It's approximately 22 minutes long)
